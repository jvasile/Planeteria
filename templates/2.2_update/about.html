      <h3>Thanks!</h3>

          <p>A project like this rests on a deep stack of impressive work
          freely shared by a multitude of others.  This page is where we
          thank those people and encourage you to check out their other
          work.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>I photoshopped the Planeteria logo 
          in <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
          from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwworks/2222523486/">a
          public domain photo</a> found on Flickr.</li>

          <li>The <a href="/pub.d/images/silhouette2.png">Unknown Blogger
          avatar</a> is based on a photo I
          gimped off of Flickr.  Unfortunately, <a
          href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-o-n-o/3502226571">the link</a> went dead and I
          can no longer find it.  All of <a
          href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-o-n-o/">Nono Fara's
          photos</a> are beautiful, though, so poke through her stream for
          some nice shots.</li>

          <li>I originally based this software on <a
          href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet Planet</a>, but quickly
          moved to build instead on <a
          href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">Venus</a>.  Later I
          discarded those dependencies for more flexibility, but my code is
          less robust as a result.  Venus is good stuff and if you're only
          running one planet, I highly recommend it.</li>

          <li>The bulk of the CSS on this site is from a template called
          FreshPick by <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">Erwin
          Aligam</a>.  Some form-specific CSS came from <a
          href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/prettyaccessibleforms/">A
          List Apart</a>.  I also grabbed some from <a
          href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-
          reloaded/">Eric Meyer</a>.</li>

          <li>I scavenged some Javascript from the web: <a
          href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum91/441.htm">hidediv</a>.</li>

          <li>I grabbed this <a
          href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/82465/">mkdir</a>
          routine.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Terms of Use</h3>

          <p>By accessing this site, you agree to the following
          terms:</p>

          <p>You grant me (James Vasile) a worldwide, perpetual,
          sublicensable royalty-free license to reprint any content
          you contribute to this site, in verbatim or modified form,
          and in any medium. This doesn't include stuff we pull in via
          rss and atom.</p>

          <p>This website inevitably collects some data about users,
          both in server logs and in the content you contribute. I
          won't share your data with spammers.</p>

          <p>You agree not to rely on this site for anything
          crucial. It might disappear or break without notice and I'm
          making no commitment to maintain it or fix it quickly (or
          ever). If you want reliability, talk to me and we'll come up
          with something that works.</p>

          <p>I store your password as plain, unobfuscated text in my
          database. Please do not use a real password on this
          site. Security ranges from lax to nonexistent. It's just
          feeds, and it's not worth the effort of real security.</p>

          <p>If your planet is inactive (i.e. nobody is pulling the
          feed or viewing the planet page on a regular basis), I'm
          probably going to delete it to conserve resources.</p>

          <p>The email address you enter is viewable by anybody who
          comes to your admin page or pulls your feed. Feel free to
          lie about your address.</p>

          <p>From time to time, I might add new terms here. You agree
          to watch this page for changes and be bound by those new
          terms.</p>

      <h3>Copying</h3>

          <p>Individual posts are copyright by their authors and I
          claim no exclusive rights to them. Click through the posts
          to the parent blogs and you should be able to find terms for
          reproduction.</p>

          <p>All of the software behind this site is open source free
          software. Everything I produced is available under the
          AGPLv3 license.</p>

          <p>I will at some point package the source code. Right now
          the code has some trashy hacks and the setup is extremely
          ugly. But now that I have running code, I'll clean it up
          slowly. Please let me know about bugs. Soon the code will be
          available from this page. But until I get around to it,
          there's always GitHub:</p>

          <blockquote>git clone git://github.com/jvasile/Planeteria.git</blockquote>

          <p>Run generate.py in the root of that branch. See the
          readme for details.</p>

          <p>A previous version of Planeteria was based on Venus,
          which I highly recommend if you are trying to run just one
          planet.</p>
