              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>Planet websites are community blog aggregators. Use
              Planeteria to collect all the personal blogs in your
              community or team and really get to know the people
              behind a project.</p>

              <p>Planeteria is not a feed reader, it's a feed
              sharer. After you make your planet, tell people about
              it. That's the whole point of community-building!</p>
